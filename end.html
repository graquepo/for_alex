            Hi baby, this is the text that I never got to write, and you'll only be seeing now. <br>
            I guess it's kind of like an easter egg since you already saw this website that I made you <br>
            and you'll only see it when you do look back to it haha. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Thank you for making my life so much brighter everyday. 
            You have motivated me to push myself to do better from working out, eating healthier, (but I still do and want to 
            eat junk food all the time lol) cooking my own food, not peeling / scracthing my body (jk), and so much more. 
            It had only been about 4 months since I started talking to you, and it's a bit crazy to think how we've grown from 
            being so shy towards each other to now kissing, hugging, and doing you know what. 
            We've been with each other almost everyday, and it feels like I'm already living with you, and I do enjoy it very much. 
            I'm so grateful to have met such a caring, kind, thoughtful, handsome, and funny guy. 
            I've never felt so appreciated, loved, and cared for (besides my parents). 
            I hope to continue to laugh, cook, eat, excercise, and have many more adventures with you. 
            I also hope to eat more soft serve matcha, yogurt, and pastries with you LOL. 
            <br>
            <br>
            If I ever said anything similar from my previous letter, then it's okay cause I <br>
            really mean it, and still think the same way everyday. Haha
